# BMI-Calculator
C++ code that computes a patient’s body mass index (BMI), according to the formula (BMI = mass/(height^2)) based on height (in meters) and mass (in kilograms).
This was an assignment for my Bioengineering 1300: Intro to Biomedical Engineering Computing Class with the following set of instructions:
Write a C++ code that computes a patient’s body mass index (BMI), according to the formula:
BMI=mass/(height^2) 
based on a height (in meters) and mass (in kilograms) entered by a user using the keyboard. Then, displays height, mass, and BMI along with a text message based on the computed BMI, as indicated in the table below. Use if-elseif-else structure instead of nested if.
Define a Boolean flag called “normal” and initialize it with value of true. If BMI is not in Normal range modify the value of that flag to false. At the end of your code, check the value of your flag, if it is false, it means that BMI is not in normal range. Send a message to your user in this case.
